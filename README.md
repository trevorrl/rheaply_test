1. 'npm install' to install Playwright
2. 'npx playwright test' to run tests

Results will open in a new browser window by default, failures are documented via video. 

If you have the vs code Playwright extension, you can run individual tests directly within vs code. 

Techniques demonstrated: 
- creating test cases from scratch
- multiple types of element selectors
- taking screenshots of pages where visual verification is wanted
- able to manage links that open new tabs/pages
- familiarity with playwright config (changing timeouts, results directory, etc)
